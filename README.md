# Pricing Panel Project

This is a Price Panel which simply means different services at different costs...

These panels can be seen at various places like Netflix or Amazon Prime monthly Subscription plans or OYO and Airbnb service charges for number of nights or Online Food Services like Zomato or Swiggy discount panels and the list goes on.

Almost, every company which provides services has these panels on their websites in one form of the other.

So, today I made a panel for Ride Booking Services which has three types of rides, mainly Bike, Auto and Sedan.
Also, I wrote its features and the price of what it costs for going from one location to the other provided by the user.
Then, the user can book the ride of his/her preference.

On first look, you will find that its just an ordinary looking static page and what's different.

But, here is the best part, if you reduce the size of the tab or if you view this page on an ipad or phone it will wrap itself in a amazingly well manner and will maintain the user experience.

I have used some wrap, flexbox and @media properties in CSS for making that happen.

Try it out !
