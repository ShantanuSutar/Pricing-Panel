# Pricing Panel Project

This is a Price Panel which simply means different services at different costs...

These panels can be seen at various places like Netflix or Amazon Prime monthly Subscription plans or OYO and Airbnb service charges for number of nights or Online Food Services like Zomato or Swiggy discount panels and the list goes on.

Almost, every company which provides services has these panels on their websites in one form of the other.

So, today I made a panel for Ride Booking Services which has three types of rides, mainly Bike, Auto and Sedan.
Also, I wrote its features and the price of what it costs for going from one location to the other provided by the user.
Then, the user can book the ride of his/her preference.

(Note: Only Frontend bcoz I am yet to learn Backend :)
